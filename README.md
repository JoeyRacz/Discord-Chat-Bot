# Discord Chat and Scheduling Bot
## Team Memebers: Stirling Sites, Joseph Racz, and Joshua Lopez
**Project Description**: Our team created a Discord bot that will generate option response options for a user when the user is pinged. We have integrated the bot with the Google Calander API to help users schedule calander events with one another.

**Technology Used:** Python PEP 8 and Google Calander API

**Next Steps to Improve The Discord Bot:** Add machine learning, add additional bot responses, and integrate the bot with other claander APIs

## Using the Chat Bot:

**Step 1:** When the user is mentioned the bot will send them a DM with options to respond
