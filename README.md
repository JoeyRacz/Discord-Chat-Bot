# Discord Chat and Scheduling Bot
## Team Memebers: Stirling Sites, Joseph Racz, and Joshua Lopez
**Project Description**: A Discord bot that when a user is pinged will generate options for a response for the user. The bot will also allow for the user the option to set the bot to automatically respond for them when pinged. We have integrated the bot with the Google Calander API to help users schedule calander events with one another.

**Technology Used**: Python PEP 8 and Google Calander API
